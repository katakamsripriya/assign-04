# Write down your observations and what did you learn new - in this file

Question 1
In this question we run two for loops on d.items() and check if the values are equal and if
they are equal we append the corresponding keys into a new list and then append the list into
a new dictionary and then return it.
Question 2
We first open the file in read mode with the help of open method and then we split the read
function at whitespaces which will give us a list and then run a for loop on
the sentiment dictionary.items() and check if the key is equal to the given sentiment type and if
yes then we append the values in a new list and then then we run nested for loops on the split
list and the new list and we check if both the elements are equal if yes then we increment the
count variable else pass.
Question 3
We open the file in read mode and then we split the file using split function and then we
run a for loop on the sentiment positive list and check if the element in the list is present
in the file as well and if yes then we increment the count variable and we do the same
procedure for the negetive sentiment list and finally we check for the conditions given on
positive and negetive comment and if any one of the condition is satisfied then we print
the corresponding type of comment that is negetive or positive comment and if neither of the
two is satisfied we print neutral comment
Question 4
We run a for loop on the list of files given to us and open each one of them in read mode using
open method and then we write .read() to read the file and then split the file at whitespaces
to obtain a list and now we check for the presence of the key in the newly obtained list and if
the condition is true we append the corresponding file name into a new list and then return it.
